# Honeyswap

### Subgraph Introduction <a href="#ethereum-mainnet" id="ethereum-mainnet"></a>

Honeyswap has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Honeyswap smart contracts.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.

This subgraph dynamically tracks any pair created by the honeyswap factory. It tracks of the current state of Honeyswap contracts, and contains derived stats for things like historical data and USD prices.

* aggregated data across pairs and tokens,
* data on individual pairs and tokens,
* data on transactions
* data on liquidity providers
* historical data on Honeyswap, pairs or tokens, aggregated by day
