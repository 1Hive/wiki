### Subgraph Introduction <a href="#ethereum-mainnet" id="ethereum-mainnet"></a>

Celeste has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Celeste smart contracts.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.
