# Subgraphs

1Hive uses The Graph's decentralized subgraph network across all products. Here is a list of our active subgraphs with information useful for developers and network participants:

* [Honeyswap](https://wiki.1hive.org/developers/subgraphs/honeyswap)
* [Celeste](https://wiki.1hive.org/developers/subgraphs/celeste)
* [Gardens](https://wiki.1hive.org/developers/subgraphs/gardens)
* [Aragon Connect](https://wiki.1hive.org/developers/subgraphs/aragon)
* [Aragon Agreements](https://wiki.1hive.org/developers/subgraphs/aragon-agreements)

These subgraphs are published and curated by a Gnosis Safe of active contributors at 1Hive. Funding for query fees was seeded from grants provided by The Graph.
