# Améliorations prévues

## Dynamic issuance policy

The new policy would regulate the Honey supply by both **issuing** and **burning** to and from the common pool in order to target a specific ratio of the total supply held in the common pool. The two primary goals of the new policy are as follows:

* Better align incentives around value creation by automatically reducing issuance or burning tokens in response to decreased outflows and/or increased inflows from buyback mechanisms. &#x20;
* Make issuance changes more predictable by relying on a clearly defined algorithmic policy rather than needing to update the issuance rate sporadically via ad-hoc decision proposals.&#x20;

The [Luna Swarm](../../community/swarms/luna.md) is working on modeling and specifying the new policy, with the intention to submit a formal proposal for implementation in January 2021.&#x20;

## Celeste integration&#x20;

Suggestions, Proposals, and Decisions will be made _disputable_, this will mean that proposers will be required to deposit Honey as collateral and other members can challenge them if they do not adhere to the [Community Covenant](../../community-covenant.md) by invoking [Celeste](../../community/swarms/celeste.md).&#x20;

The integration work is underway and is plan to happen at the same time as the launch of Celeste.
