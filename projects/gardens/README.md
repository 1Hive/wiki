# Gardens (Coming soon)

Gardens are a generalisation of the infrastructure the 1Hive protocol uses. This will enable other communities to experiment with a similar setup, allowing them to raise funds and make decisions amongst themselves effectively. Through Gardens, communities can launch their own token with their own issuance policy or use an existing token. To give a new token value they can provide some Honey during the creation process to create some initial liquidity, they may also convince the 1Hive community to give up some Honey to provide more liquidity. From there they can use whatever tools they like for coordination; chat rooms, forum etc and the token will be used for deciding how funds are used and how their infrastructure is configured, the same as the 1Hive protocol.

We hope that this will encourage and give more opportunities to people to contribute to causes they care about. Since having a say in a Garden is as simple as buying its token, individuals can very easily donate and have a stake in a cause they believe is worth pursuing. They are then incentivised to further that cause in the hope of increasing its tokenâ€™s value. This is not too dissimilar to equity in traditional businesses but with significantly less overhead and significantly greater inclusivity.

To begin with it is expected that Gardens will be created for software based projects and online communities, but ultimately it is hoped it could be used for any causes that belong in the public domain.
