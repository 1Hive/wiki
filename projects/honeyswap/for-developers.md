### Front-end

The front-end is deployed at [honeyswap.org](https://honeyswap.org) and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/1Hive/uniswap-interface). The major modifications are rebranding and a modified token list set.

### Info.honeyswap.org

A uniswap.info fork for Honeyswap. It can be viewed at [info.honeyswap.org](https://info.honeyswap.org).

### Subgraphs

The fork is powered by forks of two subgraphs:

[Uniswap v2 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1hive/uniswap-v2): A fork of the official Uniswap v2 subgraph with adjustments to use xDai as the base currency and a modified set of whitelisted tokens. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/1Hive/uniswap-v2-subgraph).

[Ethereum Blocks](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1hive/xdai-blocks): A fork of the Blocklytics Ethereum Blocks subgraph with no modifications, deployed for xDai. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/1Hive/ethereum-blocks).

### Front-end

The front-end is a fork of the official uniswap.info source code with modifications to use Blockscout instead of Etherscan along with minor adjustments to use the appropriate token lists and factory addresses.

&#x20;The source code for the front-end can be found [here](https://github.com/1Hive/uniswap-info/).

### Honeymaker

Honeymaker is a SushiMaker deployment and accompanying bot that converts LP shares on Honeyswap into Honey for the Honey Common Pool.

SushiMaker is deployed at [`0x076b64f9F966e3bBD0FCdC79D490Ab71cF961bb0`](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0x076b64f9F966e3bBD0FCdC79D490Ab71cF961bb0).

The bot periodically calls the `convert` function on the SushiMaker contract for selected pairs on Honeyswap to convert the LP shares to Honey.

The source code for the bot can be found [here](https://github.com/1hive/honeymaker).
