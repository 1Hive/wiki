# Audits & Security

The Honeyswap contracts have been audited by CertiK security assessors. You can read their audit report below.

Some changes have been made to the contracts post-audit. However, the core mechanisms remain unchanged. As a result, the audit still provides a valid assessment of the current state of the security of the main contracts.   
  
The airdrop contract have not been audited. However, the airdrop contract only holds the airdrop funds and do not interact or influence the farming contracts in any way.
