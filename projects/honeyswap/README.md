## Overview

Honeyswap is comprised of liquidity pool contracts deployed to multiple EVM compatible chains which share common frontend interfaces that are maintained by the 1Hive community. Currently Honeyswap supports xDai and Polygon, but plans to expand support to other EVM chains and rollups in the future. 

Honeyswap uses a **multi-token model** to manage the balance between **Global** and **Local** incentives. Development, support, and maintainence work that has **Global** benefits are funded using **Honey** from 1Hive's common pool. Farming Rewards, where benefits are localized to a one supported chain use a **Comb token** which can be valued as a derivative of the volume on that specific chain.

Swap fees on Honeyswap are split 1/12 to Honey, 1/12 to the local Comb token for that chain, and 5/6 directly to the pool of liquidity providers facilitating the swap.
