## Roles and Swarms

Roles are self-assigned using the 🧚**roles** channel. Assigning yourself a role gives you access to the swarm working group channel, designated by a hexagon **⏣** in the channel name. These are under the **SWARMS** heading on 1Hive's Discord. Although 🌈**design** is not a **SWARM** it is a role, so it's included in this section as well. The **SWARM** channels include 🌻**gardens-⏣, 🌷tulip-⏣, 🌺flora-⏣, 🌞celeste-⏣, 🐝buzz-⏣, 🏵pollen-⏣** and 🌈**design-⏣.**

The working group channels are for technical discussion regarding the development of relevant projects, for information about a particular project or for help using it please use the standard **BEES** channels.

## **Bot Commands**

Commands can be executed in the **🤖bot-commands** channel which provide useful information or register your account with various services.

`!hny help` - Displays a list of commands available displaying info about Honey

`!verify` - Opens a bot which helps you register your Discord account with your [verified BrightID](../../guides/brightid.md) account. This is necessary to register for pollen and to mint cred for others in Discord.

`$help` -  Will display info about depositing to your tip bot account, allowing you tip HNY to other members of the community through Discord. You can react with emojis under the help message for more details.

Further details can be seen in this [forum post](https://forum.1hive.org/t/discord-bot-commands/1298/2).
