# üå∑Tulip

The üå∑ Tulip swarm is responsible for building, deploying, maintaining and upgrading decentralized finance \(DeFi\) dApp projects for the 1Hive community. The intent of these projects is to support the 1Hive ecosystem by enabling 1Hive tokens to trade freely and create revenue streams that ultimately support the value of [HNY.](../../projects/honey/)

## Tulip Projects

[Honeyswap ](https://honeyswap.org/)is a decentralized exchange \(dex\), which uses automated market makers \(AMM\) to allow traders to swap tokens without having to interact with a third party. Honeyswap is currently deployed to [xDai ](../../projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-xdai-1.md)and [Polygon](../../projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-polygon.md). 

[Honeycomb](https://1hive.io/#/) is a web interface that is intended to become a central hub for interacting with 1Hive DeFi services, such as Honeyswap and Honeycomb farms. At present, it is primarily the way to interact with Honeycomb staking rewards.

## Joining Tulip Swarm as a Contributor

We are open to new contributors joining the swarm! In particular, we have work available for interested software developers, UX designers, product and project managers, as well as opportunities in research, marketing, and business development.

1. Folks interested in contributing to Tulip swarm should join the [Tulip Discord](https://discord.gg/qsrGE9NQzc) and introduce themselves. A good introduction should include what you're interested in working on and what skills you have. An established member of the swarm will grant you the `contributor` role, which will give you access to the rest of the channels. 
2. Tulip swarm uses a [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/tulip-602d5e1301c49f001508b160/board?repos=294258490) board to track available work, work in progress, bugs, etc. If you don't have one already, you should create a GitHub account. Someone from the swarm will add you to the [Tulip Swarm team](https://github.com/orgs/1Hive/teams/tulip-swarm) in the 1Hive GitHub. This will give you ‚Äútriage‚Äù rights on the repos that Tulip works on. Direct push access can be granted to individual contributors as necessary. 
3. In order to get paid for work, you'll need to create a profile and join the [Colony](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/tulip), then submit your profile/address in the \#payments channel. 
4. As of August 2021, the swarm is running a pilot to distribute bonus payments allocated through [Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com). To participate, ask a Coordinape Circle admin \(at the time of writing, these are @ceresbzns and @blazar\) to join and provide an ETH address to sign messages. 

### Expectations

* Contributors should attend the weekly sprint planning call \(see 1Hive google calendar\), and keep any assigned GitHub issues up to date. If you are stuck or need help, ask in the Discord to resolve blockers. Similarly, if you are looking for a task, you can ask in the Discord. 
* Contributors bill their time against issues or tasks that they have picked up. It is expected that contributors track and attribute their time appropriately. The use of time tracking software is recommended \(but not required.\)
* New swarm contributors are expected to bill at the junior rates for their respective roles at first. Once they have completed some work, they can ask for their work to be validated by established swarm members. Once validated, they can bill their time at the appropriate journeyman or senior rates for their role. 
* Established swarm contributors, particularly of the role being requested, should review the request and provide some feedback. The objective is not to be critical or exclusionary, but to ensure that work performed by new contributors achieves the quality and time to completion that meets the standards of the swarm. 
* Payments are typically distributed on a weekly basis and are paid in HNY from the Colony. Since hourly rates are denominated  in USD, the HNY/USD rate is used at the time of payment to determine HNY disbursed.
