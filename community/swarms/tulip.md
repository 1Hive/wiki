# ðŸŒ·Tulip

The ðŸŒ· Tulip swarm is responsible for building, deploying, maintaining and upgrading DeFi dApp projects for the 1Hive community. The intent of these projects is to support the 1Hive ecosystem by enabling 1Hive tokens to trade freely and create revenue streams that ultimately support the value of [HNY.](../../projects/honey/)

## Useful Links

[Honeyswap ](https://honeyswap.org/)is a decentralized exchange \(dex\), which uses automated market makers \(AMM\) to allow traders to swap tokens without having to interact with a third party. Honeyswap is currently deployed to [xDai ](../../projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-xdai-1.md)and [Polygon](../../projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-polygon.md).

[Honeycomb](https://1hive.io/#/) is a web interface that is intended to become a central hub for interacting with 1Hive DeFi services, such as Honeyswap, Honeycomb farms, and [Agave](../../guides/agave-faq.md).  At present, it is primarily the way to interact with Honeycomb staking rewards.
