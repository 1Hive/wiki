description: Building and Governing Celeste

# ðŸŒž Celeste

The ðŸŒžCeleste Swarm members are responsible for building, maintaining and initially governing Celeste. After Celeste is considered established we will transfer governance of Celeste to the 1Hive DAO. Payment for contributions are executed once every 2 weeks and can be seen in the Aragon DAO, link below. Development can be seen in the 1Hive Github org in repos preceded with "Celeste".
