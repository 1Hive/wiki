# üåê Commons

The üåêCommons Swarm is dedicated to implement the iteration 0 of Commons Stack model on top of 1hive technology. We are building our project on top of Gardens (the generalization of the 1hive infrastructure) in order to provide a different option for creating Conviction Voting DAOs.

Specifically, instead of the issuance model that 1hive uses, we replace it with a [Bonding Curve](https://commonsstack.org/abc) that allows for microeconomies to have accurate price discovery and infinite liquidity. Commons have a two token model, a reserve and a funding pool that hold a stablecoin (xDAI), and are governed by a Commons token that is minted via a bonding curve. To initialize the bonding curve, Commons have a [Hatch](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/tec-test-hatch-implementation-specification/226) in which the community is funded by a [Trusted Seed](https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-trusted-seed-of-the-commons-stack-13d7e37f2de).

The Commons Swarm is built on top of the Gardens project. Both Gardens and Commons Swarms contribute to similar codebases, especially conviction voting, and Commons broadens the concept with new features that better suits smaller economies.
