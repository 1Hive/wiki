# ðŸŒ·Tulip

The ðŸŒ· Tulip swarm is responsible for building, deploying, maintaining and upgrading decentralized finance \(DeFi\) dApp projects for the 1Hive community. The intent of these projects is to support the 1Hive ecosystem by enabling 1Hive tokens to trade freely and create revenue streams that ultimately support the value of [HNY.](../../../projects/honey/)

## Tulip Projects

[Honeyswap ](https://honeyswap.org/)is a decentralized exchange \(dex\), which uses automated market makers \(AMM\) to allow traders to swap tokens without having to interact with a third party. Honeyswap is currently deployed to [xDai ](../../../projects/honeycomb/honeyswap-on-xdai-1.md)and [Polygon](../../../projects/honeycomb/honeyswap-on-polygon.md). 

[Colony DAO](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/tulip) used for Tulip contributor payments.

[Gnosis Safe](https://xdai.gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xD5a0d695589Fa9dEC023638b8dD24D71f051C63C/balances) used as the Swarm treasury.
