# 🌜 Luna

The 🌜Luna Swarm is a collaboration of individuals and organisations that seek to rigorously model the 1Hive ecosystem in [cadCAD](http://cadcad.org/), providing tools for operational decision support including future design and governance decisions.

The Luna swarm encourages anyone interested to get involved to experiment with building new models and to help interpret the models currently being built.
