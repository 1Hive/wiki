# Tulip Swarm Contributor Onboarding Handbook

## Joining Tulip Swarm as a contributor.

We are open to new contributors joining Tulip Swarm! We have work available for software developers, UX designers, token engineers, product managers, and project managers, as well as for research, marketing, and business development. If you're interested in becoming part of Tulip Swarm you should join the Tulip Discord server and introduce yourself on the [`#onboarding-intros`](https://discord.gg/KnPNMUd27X) channel on the Tulip Discord. An established swarm member will give you the `contributor` role, which will allow you to access All The Channels.

## How to contribute to Tulip Swarm.

Tulip Swarm uses [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/tulip-602d5e1301c49f001508b160/board?repos=294258490), GitHub's online kanban, to track available work, work in progress, blockers, bugs, and so forth. If you do not have a GitHub account you will need to create one [here](https://github.com/). It's worth doing some YouTube tutorials or free online courses on Git and GitHub if you aren't familiar with how it all works. Someone from Tulip Swarm will add you to the `Tulip Swarm Team` in the 1Hive GitHub. Direct `push` access is granted on an as needed basis.

Contributors need to attend the weekly sprint planning call. Please see the [1Hive calendar](https://app.gitbook.com/@1hive/s/1hive/~/drafts/-MgdRBMUvmXAK3mZdIGQ/v/master/getting-started/calendar).  We expect that you will read the kanban board at Zenhub and will see an issue on the board that you can pick up. If you have questions about any issues on the Zenhub please ask in the Discord. Otherwise, you can ask for clarification on issues at the weekly sprint planning call. Please feel free to ask around on the Tulip Swarm Discord server if you would like guidance or suggestions finding a way to contribute. Also, if you __can think of a way that _you_ would like to add value, please feel free to discuss on the Discord, or better yet, do it.

## Getting paid

In order to get paid for work you will need to create a profile for and join the [1Hive Colony](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/tulip) at [colony.io](https://colony.io/). You will need Ethereum Mainnet and xDai network in your wallet. If you have any wallet or network issues please access support at the [1Hive \#help channel](https://discord.gg/MZqr8CaUJj).  Colony.io has a small fee in ETH to sign the transaction to create your profile. Be sure to submit your profile name and eth address to the \#payments channel on the Tulip Discord server.

You also need to sign up at [Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/team). Currently @ceresbzns, @Blazar, and @metaverde are admins, so you'll need to get the eth address you would like to use to sign in to one of them.  Be sure to award your allotted Gift each week to your Fellow contributors.
