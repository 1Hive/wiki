# 🏵 Pollen

The 🏵Pollen Swarm manages the 1Hive SourceCred instance. Details can be seen in [Earn Pollen](../../getting-started-1/how-can-you-contribute/pollen.md). The Swarm is responsible for ensuring the system isn't easily exploitable, keeping parameters up-to-date and distributing pollen rewards.
