# Cours

The [Morphosis swarm](../swarms/morphosis.md) creates courses to help add value to the 1Hive community. Our first course, Data Analysis, started January 18, 2021. There will be more courses available soon. To find out more about Morphosis courses or to help in the creation of courses check out the 🦋**morphosis** channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/y7gFW4UCHk).

The classes are held on the 1Hive Discord server in a dedicated voice channel called _classroom_. This channel is grouped with the other voice channels, but it is only visible to enrollees. Once you have enrolled in a course the _classroom_ voice channel will be added to the rooms you are able to see. This prevents disruption to classes in session. Other voice channels on our Discord are open for people to drop in.
