**When will the product launch?**\
Our [Agave Platform](https://agave.finance) is officially up and running from September 1st! Prior to launch, the audit of Agave's contracts has been completed by [Chainsulting](https://chainsulting.de) on May 1st.

**Where can I find a roadmap for Agave?**\
Here is a simplified roadmap for Agave, subject to change

![Agave Roadmap](../.gitbook/assets/image0.png)

**What about marketing?**\
Marketing will begin as soon as Agave is deployed, as presented in the roadmap. Any indirect marketing before token launch will just occur through proposals, documentation, token listings.

Our main marketing push will be in coordination with Agave's deployment, [Celeste](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/), Honeyswap v3, to promote the entire 1hive ecosystem as a whole.

**Is $AGVE on Coingecko?**\
Yes! Here’s the link: [$AGVE - Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/agave-token).

**Can I contribute in some way?**\
Your participation is always welcome. We've recently published a first list of open bounties, which you can access by [clicking here](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-bounty-board-subject-to-changes/4038). Other bounties related to 1Hive are available [here](https://www.notion.so/3e13ef2a5d614a828b684640af2212b4?v=20b21ead637341faa87416b85202b584) and are claimable by getting in touch with Buzz Dao.

**Where can I see a chart of $AGVE?**\
[Here](https://info.honeyswap.org/token/0x3a97704a1b25f08aa230ae53b352e2e72ef52843) you can see the chart for $AGVE from the Honeyswap Analytics page.

Other available charts are on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/agave-token) and [Moontools](https://app.moontools.io/pairs/honeyswap/0x0e3e9cceb13c9f8c6faf7a0f00f872d6291630de).

**Where can I track LP rewards?**\
LP tracking can be found on [Liquidityfolio](https://www.liquidityfolio.com)

**Will there be a future airdrop?**\
Although this is pure speculation since we are a DAO and this would require a community vote there appears to be some interest in an airdrop after deployment. The airdrop could focus on attracting TVL. This portion of the airdrop can be very specifically targeted to eliminate gaming. There may also be a marketing/hype component giving people ample time to so people may participate.

**How can I provide liquidity and for which pair?**\
At the moment, the 3 largest pairs for $AGVE: [AGVE-WETH](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0xeba7cc57e6f745b8d5cab829e07346c65393d78e), [AGVE-HNY](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0x50a4867aee9cafd6ddc84de3ce59df027cb29084) and [AGVE-XDAI](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0x0e3e9cceb13c9f8c6faf7a0f00f872d6291630de).

## Staking

**Can I stake $AGVE?**\
As of May 10th, you can finally stake your Agave. [Click here](https://app.agave.finance/#/stake) to access the app

**What is the cooldown period?**\
The cooldown is how long you have to wait to withdraw a stake. It is a "safety module". The idea is that you can't immediately withdraw your staked tokens, since you are staking to protect from a shortfall event.

**What is a shortfall?**\
[Click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortfall.asp) for a definition of shortfall.

**What happens when I click on "Activate Cooldown?**\
When you activate the cooldown period you'll have to wait 10 days before unstaking your tokens. Then, you'll have 2 days to click "unstake" --> window closes

**What happens if you don’t withdraw during 2 day window?**\
If you don't withdraw within the 2 days, the window closes and you have to reactivate the cooldown period.

**Do I still receive staking rewards during the cooldown period?**\
Yes! You receive staking rewards until you don't unstake your tokens.

**Where did the 500 AGAVE come from?**\
The 500 Agave (0.5% of the total supply) were proposed and voted by the community in one of the recent votes. [Click here](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-votes-apr-22/3489) to read more.

**If I stake AGAVE, do I get a "stakedAGAVE" token?**\
Yes, you get stkAGVE.

**Will it be possible to vote with stkAGVE too?**\
Currently, this is not possible, but everything is in place to allow this function once we upgrade the DAO. We will be having an "unstake party" to vote when that happens.

**What happens in 6 months, does it automatically unstake?**\
Maybe. You may still have to manually unstake at that time. We’ll communicate before then about what will happen when the period ends. There won't be any loss of rewards if you don't unstake right away, but you will still have the cooldown to contend with. Our plan is that this will transition to receiving a share of the protocol rewards when it launches, in which case you wouldn't ever want to unstake.
