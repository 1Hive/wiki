# Discord



Discord is one of the main tools we use to communicate. On this platform we catch up with the different projects our community members are working on, discuss and pitch new ideas, arrange meetings, support users experiencing technical issues, reward users who are contributing, and also engage in casual discussions. Join and say hi:

## Channels

Most channels are focussed on discussion around a particular topic, which can be seen in the channel description at the top of the Discord screen. However, some channels are used for purposes other than discussion:

* **🐛onboarding** is for opting into [Pollen](../how-can-you-contribute/earn-pollen.md), check the pinned message and follow the instructions.
* **🤖bot-commands** is for summoning Discord bots to give information, register your account with BrightID or setup a tipping account. See [details below](../../community/media/discord.md#bot-commands) for commands that can be used in the bot commands channel.
* **✅check-in** is for daily/multi-daily/weekly status updates from 1Hive contributors.
* **🍄nominations** is where you can recognize the work of others, particularly those that you feel are not being properly recognized elsewhere. Pollen is weighted differently in this channel, see the end of the [Pollen Weights](../how-can-you-contribute/earn-pollen.md#pollen-weights) section for details.
* 🍯**keepers** is for those with the 🍯**Honey** role which can only be assigned if you own 1 Honey.

## Roles and Swarms

Roles are self-assigned using the 🧚**roles** channel. Assigning yourself a role gives you access to the swarm working group channel, designated by a hexagon **⏣** in the channel name. These are under the **SWARMS** heading on 1Hive's Discord. Although 🌈**design** is not a **SWARM** it is a role, so it's included in this section as well. The **SWARM** channels include 🌻**gardens-⏣, 🌷tulip-⏣, 🌺flora-⏣, 🌞celeste-⏣, 🐝buzz-⏣, 🏵pollen-⏣** and 🌈**design-⏣.**

The working group channels are for technical discussion regarding the development of relevant projects, for information about a particular project or for help using it please use the standard **BEES** channels.

## **Bot Commands**

Commands can be executed in the **🤖bot-commands** channel which provide useful information or register your account with various services.

`!hny help` - Displays a list of commands available displaying info about Honey

`!verify` - Opens a bot which helps you register your Discord account with your [verified BrightID](../../guides/brightid/) account. This is necessary to register for pollen and to mint cred for others in Discord.

`$help` -  Will display info about depositing/withdrawing to/from your tip bot account, allowing you tip HNY to other members of the community through Discord. You can react with emojis under the help message for more details.

Further details can be seen in this [forum post](https://forum.1hive.org/t/discord-bot-commands/1298/2).
