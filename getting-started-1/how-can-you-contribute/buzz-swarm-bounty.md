# Buzz Swarm Bounty

The [Buzz Swarm](https://1hive.gitbook.io/1hive/community/swarms/buzz) has a bounty program in place that anyone can participate in it  by completing tasks that can be seen on the  [Bounty Board ](https://www.notion.so/3e13ef2a5d614a828b684640af2212b4?v=20b21ead637341faa87416b85202b584). Members have the capacity to submit a [Bounty Request ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9zyx3qV2n5iuO8LdmPQiYHdZpY-NcSH6YkvvCxSq7D-Fo9g/viewform) for tasks they deem valuable as marketing initiatives.

For example if Buzz is doing a promotion and they require graphic designs, a relevant bounty will be posted in an open context that anyone can provide their services on. Payment terms are decided on a case by case basis. [More details can be seen in page 16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1giD4QcVfHNUaAwcXWqEdV4jI2CUSQH24/view)
