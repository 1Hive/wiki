# Get Honey

Honey is the community currency of 1Hive, it is also an important community boundary. In order to influence the direction of 1Hive, Honey holders can stake their honey on proposals.

In order to participate in this process you must first acquire some Honey. Currently there are 5 primary ways to do this:

1. Get validated on [BrightId](../../guides/brightid.md) and register and claim free Honey from the [faucet](https://faucet.1hive.org/#/). 
2. Contribute to the 1Hive community on [GitHub](https://github.com/1Hive), [Discord](https://discord.gg/SRYMKh3C4W), and [Discourse](https://forum.1hive.org/). These contributions are tracked using SourceCred and [Earn Pollen](earn-pollen.md), which is like a contributor score. Honey is distributed weekly on the basis of these scores. 
3. Help out around the community and you may be spotted by one of the [Fauna](../../community/swarms/fauna.md) members and [awarded for your help](fauna-awards.md). 
4. Look for something you can do to improve 1Hive and submit a funding proposal to the [1Hive DAO](../../projects/honey/participation.md). 
5. Buy honey on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap) with xDai and other cryptocurrencies.
