# Navigation Guide

There are various **Projects** and [**Swarms**](../community/swarms/), with goals that range from communicating to developing new protocols and platforms for 1Hive. Below is a brief description of them.

## Projects

[🍯**Honey**](../projects/honey/) - A DAO that issuances and distributes 1Hive's community currency Honey. Honey holders can create and stake on proposals using the open source frontend hosted at [1hive.org](https://1hive.org).

[🍃**Honeyswap**](../projects/honeyswap/) - A fork of Uniswap v2 on xDai enabling Swaps, Flash Loans, and Oracles for the xDai community, a portion of fees from volume on honeyswap is used to buy Honey and send it to the 1Hive common pool. 

[🌞**Celeste**](../projects/celeste.md) - A subjective oracle protocol that incorporates BrightId to make participation less capital intensive. It will be used, among other things, to enforce the [1Hive Community Covenant](../community-covenant.md).

[🌻**Gardens**](../projects/gardens.md) - A platform where communities can issue their own currencies and existing token projects can engage their community by sponsoring community directed development efforts. 

## Swarms

🌷**Tulip** - A swarm working on trading and DeFi infrastructure including Honeyswap, a fork of uniswap v2 that will incentivize liquidity provision using Honey. And other “Bee-Fi” related projects.

[🐝**Buzz**](../community/swarms/buzz.md) - A swarm focussed on communicating, documenting, and generally spreading awareness about 1Hive and Honey to help cross-pollinate our ideas to the rest of the world. Also makes honey memes.

[🏵**Pollen**](../community/swarms/pollen.md) - A swarm and system that maintains our SourceCred instance to distribute Honey based on contributions in Discord, Discourse \(the Forum\) and Github.

🌺**Flora** - A swarm working on dev ops, infrastructure and node operations. Flora is currently exploring running a validators and emerging roll-up chains.

[🐱**Fauna**](../community/swarms/fauna.md) ****- A swarm dedicated to moderation of our discussion channels. Members of this swarm are the ones you're likely to come in contact with should you need help with anything.

[🦋**Morphosis**](../community/swarms/morphosis.md) ****- A swarm creating educational content and running online courses in various subjects including analytics and development. Morphosis hopes to enable and encourage more contribution to the 1Hive ecosystem.

[🌜**Luna**](../community/swarms/luna.md) ****- A swarm that is focussed on modeling and simulation of economic principles to help inform concepts and configuration for various applications within the 1Hive ecosystem.
