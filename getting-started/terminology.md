# Terminology

There are various **Projects** and [**Swarms**](../community/swarms/), with goals that range from communicating to developing new protocols and platforms for 1Hive.

## Projects

[🍯**Honey**](../projects/honey/) - A protocol that issues and distributes 1Hive's community currency, Honey. Honey holders can create and stake on proposals using the open source frontend hosted at [1hive.org](https://1hive.org).

[🍃**Honeyswap**](../projects/honeyswap/) - A fork of Uniswap v2 on xDai enabling Swaps, Flash Loans, and Oracles for the xDai community. A portion of fees from volume on Honeyswap is used to buy Honey and send it to the 1Hive common pool.

[🌞**Celeste**](../projects/celeste.md) - A subjective oracle protocol that incorporates BrightId to make participation less capital intensive. It will be used, among other things, to enforce the [1Hive Community Covenant](../community-covenant.md).

[🌻**Gardens**](../projects/gardens/) - A platform where communities can issue their own currencies and existing token projects can engage their community by sponsoring community directed development efforts.

## Swarms

🌷**Tulip** - A swarm working on trading and DeFi infrastructure including Honeyswap, a fork of uniswap v2 that will incentivize liquidity provision using Honey. And other “Bee-Fi” related projects.

[🐝**Buzz**](../community/swarms/buzz.md) - A swarm focussed on communicating, documenting, and generally spreading awareness about 1Hive and Honey to help cross-pollinate our ideas to the rest of the world. Also makes honey memes.

[🏵**Pollen**](../community/swarms/pollen.md) - A swarm and system that maintains our SourceCred instance to distribute Honey based on contributions in Discord, the Forum and Github.

🌺[**Flora** ](../community/swarms/flora.md) - A swarm working on dev ops, infrastructure and node operations. Flora is currently exploring running a validators and emerging roll-up chains.

[🐱**Fauna**](../community/swarms/fauna.md) - A swarm dedicated to moderation of our discussion channels. Members of this swarm are the ones you're likely to come in contact with should you need help with anything.

[🦋**Morphosis**](../community/swarms/morphosis.md)- A swarm creating educational content and running online courses in various subjects including analytics and development. Morphosis hopes to enable and encourage more contribution to the 1Hive ecosystem.

[🌜**Luna**](../community/swarms/luna.md) - A swarm that is focused on modeling and simulation of economic principles to help inform concepts and configuration for various applications within the 1Hive ecosystem.

🌍[**Terra** ](../community/swarms/terra.md) - A swarm dedicated to translating 1hive projects, documentation and resources.

[🐛**Bug Bounty**](../community/swarms/bug-bounty.md) - A swarm that manages funds available for the 1Hive Contract Bug Bounty program. It is responsible for interpreting and responding to uncovered exploits.

[🌐**Commons**](../community/swarms/commons.md) - A swarm dedicated to implement the iteration 0 of Commons Stack model on top of 1hive technology. We are building our project on top of Gardens in order to provide a different option for creating Conviction Voting DAOs.
